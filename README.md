# FF_DRL
This Repo is an attempt to solve gym env using the forwardforward leanring metho from g.hinton. Autors Robin Junod, supervised by Giulio Romanelli. This is a semester project at the EPFL, Master (robotic/datascience).

It can be devided in 3 parts

1 survival focused , cartpole 
2 DQN , cartpole 
3 DQN with CNN, breakout

## Installation and depedencies
packages needed: pytorch, sklearn, pandas, numpy, gymnasium, gym atari, matplotlib, stablebaseline3


## Part 1 : survival-focused

Promissing results have been achieved with a really straightfowrad implementation on the simple cartpole env.
### Run the training phase
### Run the inference 
### Results

## Part 2 : simple DQN
Adapt the FF to the well knwon DQN algorithm. This task contains a new algorithm to solve regression task with Forward-Forward. 

### Run the training phase
### Run the inference 
### Results


## Part 3 : advanced DQN
This is an attempt of solving mroe complex env like breakout. This kind of env are interessting because they are dealing with images, and requires CNN to be efficient. 
### Run the training phase
### Run the inference 
### Results
